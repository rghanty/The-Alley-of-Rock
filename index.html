                    <p class = "band-info">Formed in 1968, the British rock band Led Zeppelin rose to fame in the early
                    1970s after their eponymously titled debut studio album Led Zeppelin. Consisting of
                    singer Robert Plant (right), lead guitarist Jimmy Page (center), bassist John Paul Jones (left) and drummer
                    John Bonham (top), this band revolutionised hard rock and blues with their energetic
                    performances and mesmerizing discography.</p>

                    their fast tempos, and aggressive musicianship, Metallica has been part of the heavy metal
                    scene since the 1980s. Gaining commercial success with their third album Master Of Puppets,
                    which is cited as the band's best work, Metallica made sure they were there to stay.</p>
